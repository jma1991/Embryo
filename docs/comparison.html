Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility. The version displayed above was the version of the Git repository at the time these results were generated. <br><br> Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:

<h2>Differential abundance</h2>
<p>In this section we are going to test for differential genotype abundance within each cluster and celltype annotation. This experiment does not contain replicates so we cannot use something like edgeR to perform the differential testing. Instead, we will use the binomial test which uses data to test whether a population proportion matches a null expectation for the population. In our case the null expectation is that Het and Hom cells have equal proportion within each cluster or celltype annotation.</p>
